# debian-sway
A simple init script for clean debian12 install, using sway vm.


## things to do:
    - alsa (sound)
    - gnome.keyring https://major.io/p/use-gnome-keyring-with-sway/
    - think about to manage packages. packages.txt should stay in ```/root```
        this way we can ensure, no accidental modification happens.
